## What is Datacolor Spyder?

Datacolor Spyder is a comprehensive suite of color management tools trusted by creative professionals worldwide. Its primary function is to calibrate computer monitors to ensure they display colors accurately and consistently, which is a fundamental requirement for photography, design, and video post-production.

The system utilizes a high-quality hardware colorimeter that you place on your screen. This device works in tandem with intuitive yet powerful software to analyze the display's output across the entire color gamut. It then builds a custom color profile that corrects any discrepancies in gamma, white point, and luminance, tailoring the image to professional standards.

Beyond simple calibration, Spyder software offers advanced features like room light monitoring, which adjusts the screen's brightness and color temperature to match your ambient lighting conditions. It also supports profiling for multiple monitors, ensuring a uniform visual experience across a dual-screen or multi-display setup. This level of precision ensures that the work you create on your screen will look exactly as intended when printed, published online, or viewed on other calibrated devices.
